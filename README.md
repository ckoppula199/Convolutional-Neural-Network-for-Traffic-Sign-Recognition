# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Traffic-Sign-Recognition  
  
Data for this project can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign  
  
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify 43 different types of trafic signs. An application of this could be used in autonomous vehicles.  
  
For this project to work the data needs to be structured in a specific way. You must have a Data folder and inside that Data folder there should be a Test and Train folder containing the test and train datasets. There should also be a Test.csv file.  
  
I have included sample images to demonstrate the required folder structure and also provided the Test.csv file.
